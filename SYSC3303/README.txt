The goal of this iteration is to extend the client, error simulator, and server programs to support steady-state file transfer. For this part, assume that no errors occur.


Set Up Instruction:
---------------------------------------
	1. extract .zip file
      2. open Eclipse and set workspace path
      3. copy the path of the file you would like to transfer
      4. run Server.java, ErrorSimulator.java and Client.java
      5. go to the console page of Client
      6. type "Normal" (please don't type "")
      7. type "WRQ" or "RRQ"
      8. paste the file path or type "testWRQ" (for sending testWRQ.txt file to Server / "testRRQ" for sending testRRQ.txt to Client)
      9. done :)
